        <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification is a mod to   bring some of the elements of Icewind Dale into the Baldur's Gate series   of games. A lot of this project is based upon the work of the discontinued <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/155-icewind-dale-in-baldurs-gate-ii/"><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></a> conversion project, which later formed the backbone of IWDEE. </p>
        <p>Please report any bugs on the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/185-iwdification/">forums</a> so that they can be addressed. </p>

        <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification  works on all <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games that use the Baldur's Gate II engine, which includes the original   Baldur's Gate II (Shadows of Amn with or without  Throne of Bhaal), the   two major Baldur's Gate conversion mods (Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>),   and the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II. Content will be adjusted as   appropriate for the detected platform--e.g. no +5 items or ninth level   spells will be added to a Tutu or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym> game. </p>
<p><strong>For non-EE games: </strong></p>
<p>You will see references to &quot;original&quot; or &quot;vanilla&quot; BG2 to differentiate it from the Enhanced Editions. Note that this includes any installation running on the original BG2 engine, notably BGT or Tutu. </p>
        <p><a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> is   highly recommended for players using the spell packs on the original games. Without <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a>,   spell selection screens during character creation are limited to 24   spells, as are spellbook pages. Since there are more than 24 spells   available at some levels you will not be able to see all spells   available or be able to select them. Cat's Grace, a second-level arcane   spell, relies on functionality provided by <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> and will be skipped if   it's not detected. </p>
        <p>The fourth-level divine spell Giant Insect relies on <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>, as the beetles summoned by the spell do not have animations in the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,   and will be skipped without the mod being installed. Polymorph Self and druidic shapeshifting will also have an additional option, Boring Beetle, if IA is installed.      </p>

      <p>If you should encounter any bugs, please report them to the authors at the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/185-iwdification/">IWDification</a> forum. In addition, IWDification is <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/iwdification">available on GitHub</a>, so fixes and changes can be submitted by the community. </p>
      <h3>Known Mod Conflicts</h3>
      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard: Add IWD Bard Songs</strong> will overwrite the bard song changes from Rogue Rebalancing's <strong>Bard Kit revisions</strong> component. It also conflicts with the bard song changes introduced for Garrick in the <strong>Garrick: Tales of a Troubadour</strong> mod. </p>
      <p>IWDification should be installed before argent77's <strong>Trials of the Luremaster for Baldur's Gate</strong> mod. </p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>Two-handed axes use the same combat and paperdoll animations as halberds. </p>
      <p>Contact Other Plane has no dialogue written, and is therefore unavailable at present.      </p>
      <p>With <strong>Randomized Enemy Equipment</strong>, a handful of creatures get multiple weapons. An even smaller percentage of these will sometimes only drop one of these two weapons on death. </p>
      <h3>Known Issues (Non-EE Games)      </h3>
      <p>For the <strong>Arcane</strong> and <strong>Divine Spell Packs</strong>, not all spells could be converted to the original Baldur's Gate II engine. The Cat's Grace spell (part of the <strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong>) requires <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> for its unique dexterity modifications. Giant Insect (part of the <strong>Divine Spell Pack</strong>) requires the beetle animation, part of <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>.  Soul Eater, Seven Eyes, Favor of Ilmater, and Spiritual Wrath are not available. All of the compromises made for the <strong>Arcane</strong> or <strong>Divine Spell Packs</strong> can be found in the notes on their respective spell listings (<a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwdification/arcane/">arcane</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwdification/divine/">divine</a>). </p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
      </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.      </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
      The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        IWDification for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> iwdification</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>MacOS</strong><br />
        IWDification for macOS  is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdification</strong>, <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> iwdification</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
      IWDification for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not   include a WeiDU installer.  Linux users will need to do a one-time   install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall iwdification' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-iwdification --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</p>

      <h3>Miscellaneous Changes </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Icewind Dale Casting Graphics (Andyr)</strong><br />
      <em>Also available in the Tweaks Anthology mod </em></p>
<p> When your character casts a spell, you get a pretty sequence of colors swirling      around their hand depending on the school the spell cast came from. A necromantic      spell, for example, looks quite different from creating an illusion. The      Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games use different sets of animations for      the schools. This component changes the spellcasting animations to those      of Icewind Dale. Note that this is purely a cosmetic change--the spells      themselves function exactly as before. Screenshots for comparison are available      in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/27-tweaks-anthology/">Tweaks      gallery</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Commoners Use Drab Colors</strong><br />
      <em>Also available in the Tweaks Anthology mod </em></p>
<p> Unlike Icewind Dale, commoners in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> wear      brightly colored clothes. This tweak changes the random selections of colors      for commoners to a drab palette. The dress of noblemen and noblewomen are      not affected. </p>
<p><strong>Two Handed Axes</strong></p>
<p>Icewind Dale also featured two-handed axes, as opposed to the   strictly one-handed variety found in the Baldur's Gate series. This   component scatters normal and magical two-handed axes throughout the   game to make them available for players. Two-handed axes use the axe   proficiency and have base stats of 9 speed and <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym> damage. Spoilers about their <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/29150-2h-axe-location-documentation-where/?tab=comments#comment-258090">precise locations</a> are available on the forums. </p>
<p><strong>Expanded Polymorph Self Options</strong></p>
<p>This component adds three new forms to the arcane Polymorph Self spell: winter wolf, polar bear, and boring beetle (the boring beetle requires <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a> on original BG2). </p>
<p><strong>Randomized Enemy Equipment</strong><br />
  <em>Enhanced Editions Only</em></p>
<p>Icewind Dale routinely randomized the weapons and other equipment of enemy mobs, e.g. skeletons in IWD could attack with just about any melee or ranged weapon in the game. This component does the same for BG and BG2 random enemies. It is limited somewhat by the animation system of the game:  gnolls, for example, only support weapon animations for long swords and halberds so the randomization is limited. You can optionally install high-quality items--these are non-magical items that provide an additional +1 to-hit over their normal counterparts--to provide a little more variation. If the<strong> Two Handed Axes</strong> component is installed, these will also be added to the mix. </p>
<p>At present, this component only randomizes equipment on truly random mobs, e.g. most hobgoblins in BG will get randomized equipment but special, fixed groups (such as the ones with Joia's ring at the Friendly Arms Inn) will not. This is done primarily to avoid conflicts with other mods which may alter equipment. You can read more details about this on the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33232-randomized-enemy-equipment-details/">relevant forum thread</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong></p>
      <p> This component adds more than 30 arcane spells from Icewind Dale. This component does not alter existing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> spells to match their <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> counterparts, except as noted below. <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwdification/arcane/">Complete descriptions</a> are available on the project pages as well as in-depth technical information. </p>

      <sup>2</sup> Only available for EE games OR vanilla games with TobEx installed</p>
<p><strong>Divine Spell Pack </strong></p>
      <p> This component adds more than 40 divine spells from Icewind Dale and does not alter existing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> spells to match their <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> counterparts. Divine spellcasters will receive these spells, as appropriate, in their spellbooks as they level up. Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> also receive updates to their spellbooks to account for the new spells. <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwdification/divine/">Complete descriptions</a> are available on the project pages as well as in-depth technical information. </p>

      <p><sup>1</sup> Only available for EE games<br />
      <sup>2</sup> Only available for vanilla games with Infinity Animations installed</p>
      <p><strong>Expanded Portrait Icons</strong><br />
      <em>Non-EE Games Only</em></p>
      <p>On the Enhanced Editions, all of the Icewind Dale portrait icons for the spells in the <strong>Arcane </strong>and<strong> Divine Spell Packs</strong> and the songs from <strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard</strong> are added. Unlike the Enhanced Editions, portrait icons in the original BG2 are limited to a fixed number of slots and, as such, many of the imported spells and bard songs do not get their unique portrait icons. These are made available as a separate component because there's no easy way to patch these into the game and this component will destructively overwrite changes made by other mods to expand the portrait icon system.</p>

      <h3>IWD Class Updates</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
<p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard: Add IWD Bard Songs (formerly known as Bard Song</strong>)</p>
      <p>Bards in Icewind Dale gained different bard songs as they leveled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Ballad of Three Heroes &mdash; Available at level one, this   provides all allies with +1 to hit, +1 damage, and +1 to saving throws.</li>
        <li>The Tale of Curran Strongheart &mdash; Available at level three, this   song protects the party from fear and removes any current fear effects.</li>
        <li>Tymora's Melody &mdash; Available at level five, the party gains +1 luck, +3 to all saves, and +10 to lore and thieving skills.</li>
        <li>The Song of Kaudies &mdash; Available at level seven, this provides a   50% resistance to sound-based attacks and spells such as power words,   sirine charm, silence, and others.</li>
        <li>The Siren's Yearning &mdash; Available at level nine, this song   enthralls your foes, preventing action for five rounds on a failed save   vs. spell.</li>
        <li>War Chant of the Sith &mdash; Available at level 11, this provides +2 <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>, regeneration of two <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym>/round, and 10% resistance to all crushing, missile, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As the songs become available to the bard, the ability to freely   switch between them is available. This component only affects trueclass   bards, as the available kits use variants of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> bard song for kit advantages and/or disadvantages. Bards with these new songs will not be able to pick Enhanced Bard Song as a high-level ability. </p>
      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard: Use IWD Spell Progression</strong><br />
      <em>Also available in the Tweaks Anthology mod </em></p>
      <p>Bards in Icewind Dale could learn up to eighth-level spells and this component makes the IWD table available. This is also available in Tweaks Anthology as  <strong>Alter Bard Spell Progression Table: Un-Nerfed Table</strong>. A <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_tables.html#bard" rel="external nofollow">comparison of the spell progression tables</a> is available from the Tweaks documentation. </p>
<p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Druid: Use IWD Shapeshifting and Ability Progression</strong></p>
<p>This makes several changes to the druid class. Trueclass druids swap their BG2 shapeshifting (wolf, black bear, brown bear) for the IWD progression: winter wolf (level 5), boring beetle (level 7, but kept as black bear for vanilla games without <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>), polar bear (level 9), fire elemental (level 11), earth elemental (level 13), and water elemental (level 15). Immunity from poison is moved from level 15 to level 9, and instead of the BG2 elemental resists at levels 18/21/24, the druid becomes immune to fatigue at level 15. </p>
<p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Druid: Allow Elves to be Druids</strong><br />
  <em>Enhanced Editions Only</em></p>
      <p> As simple as it gets: this opens the druid class and fighter-druid multi-class to elves, but is only available on EE games.</p>
      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Paladin: IWD Abilities and Skills</strong></p>
      <p>The paladin's Detect Evil ability becomes an at-will ability, and Protection From Evil only protects the paladin but lasts 24 hours. Paladins can cast Cure Disease (per the cleric spell) once per day and Smite Evil once per day (does 1d6 plus 1d6 per thee levels of magic damage to an evil opponent). Paladins are now immune to disease and become immune to fear at level three. They also receive an expanded spellcasting table, being able to start casting spells at level 6 instead of 9. </p>
      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Paladin: Use IWD Spell Progression</strong><br />
        <em>Also available in the Tweaks Anthology mod </em></p>
      <p> Icewind Dale expanded the level and number of spells high level   paladins could cast. This component replaces the game tables with those   of <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW. </abbr>This is also available in Tweaks Anthology as <strong> Paladins Use <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> Spell Progression Tables (grogerson)</strong>.

      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Ranger: Use IWD Spell Progression</strong><br />

      <p> Icewind Dale expanded the level and number of spells high level rangers   could cast. This component replaces the game tables with those of <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW. </abbr>This is also available in Tweaks Anthology as <strong>Rangers Use <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> Spell Progression Tables (grogerson)</strong>. A <a href="file:///D:/docs/IE Mod Packaging/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_tables.html#ranger" rel="external nofollow">comparison of the spell progression tables</a> is available from the Tweaks documentation. </p>
      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Thief: Evasion</strong><br />
      <em>Enhanced Edition Only</em></p>
      <p>At level seven, thieves earn the Evasion perk. When a thief is hit by a spell that can be evaded (Fireball, Lightning Bolt, etc.), the thief is allowed a Save vs. Breath to completely avoid the effects. If the Saving Throw is failed, the spell works normally, including a save for half damage if the spell allows for it. A helpless thief (e.g. held, stunned, or asleep) cannot use Evasion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/profile/8-camdawg/">CamDawg</a> created this mod, based primarily on the hard work of <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/profile/1067-davidw/">DavidW</a> on <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, and furthered by the Beamdog team for IWDEE.

      <p>Since this mod, and in particular the spell packs, draw heavily upon the work in <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,   the same thanks and acknowledgments apply. In particular thanks to    Nythrun, who helped immensely with the conversion of the spells. Thanks   to Andyr for the development of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> casting graphics, lifted entirely from the  Tweaks Anthology. </p>
      <p>I'd also like to thank TotoR, who identified several issues and provided working versions of Shout, Great Shout, Wall of Moonlight, Smashing Wave, and Mordenkainen's Force Missiles for oBG2. Thanks to Luke who identified several issues with the IWDEE 2.6 spells, and thanks to Galactygon for same as well as advice on getting the new IWD spells to blend in more with their BG2 counterparts. Thanks to subtledoctor for providing the code for getting the spells to work with SR's spell deflection. </p>

        <p><strong>Version 1 - December 20, 2021</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Version Release Candidate 2 - September 30, 2021</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some general re-organization of the mod components:
            <ul>
              <li>Everything in the IWD Class Updates group was renamed in a more consistent scheme</li>
              <li>Added <strong>Randomized Enemy Equipment</strong> as a component for EE games</li>
              <li>Split the paladin class updates into separate components, <strong>IWD Class Updates: Paladin: IWD Abilities and Skills</strong> and <strong>IWD Class Updates: Paladin: Use IWD Spell Progression</strong></li>
              <li>Similarly, the two druid class updates are presented as separate components rather than as a menu </li>
              <li>Added the <strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard: Use IWD Spell Progression </strong>and <strong>IWD Class Updates: Ranger: Use IWD Spell Progression</strong> components. All of the spell progression components are from Tweaks Anthology, and will not cross-install</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Updated the core converter for the <strong>Arcane </strong>and<strong> Divine Spell Packs</strong> and bard songs for <strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard</strong>. The core converter now also handles the <strong>Additional Portrait Icons</strong> component. Amongst its improvements:
            <ul>
              <li>Portrait icons for the new spells were not working on EE installs. </li>
              <li>Entropy Shield was supposed to block the damage from Flame Strike while allowing the visuals to play, but was instead outright removing the damage from Flame Strike. Evasion also wasn't being applied to the new Flame Strike variants. </li>
              <li>Whirlwind's stun effect was bypassing magic resistance; Alicorn Lance also had MR issues</li>
              <li>Removed some redundant cruft from various spells</li>
              <li>Mold Touch really is fixed now. For real. Seriously.</li>
              <li>Cloud of Pestilence had some incorrect durations on its immunity effects</li>
              <li>missile.ids entries are now added alongside projectl.ids entries</li>
              <li>Suffocate's slow effect could be avoided with free action</li>
              <li>Summoned lizardmen now have weapons</li>
              <li>Symbol, Pain's description is now accurate</li>
              <li>Spiritual Wrath, Smashing Wave, and Lance if Disruption had incomplete projectiles sue to missing animations</li>
              <li>Incorporated numerous cosmetic suggestions from Galactygon to help the new spells blend in with the existing  spells</li>
              <li>Harm no longer affects extra-planar creatures, bringing it in-line with other Cause X Wounds spells</li>
              <li>Fixed some oversights in the cross-patching routines (e.g. making sure a new divine spell properly blocks/checks for a new arcane spell)</li>
              <li>Rather than trying to (incompletely) block individual petrification spells and abilities, Iron Body now makes the user immune to petrification outright</li>
              <li>Seven Eyes was not accounting for the various BG2 clones of spells it should be protecting from/reacting to, Eye of Fortitude was also requiring a target to cast</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug that prevented installation on BGEE</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug that prevented installation on oBG2 when Infinity Animations (specifically the beetle animation) was installed</li>
              <li>Fixed animation/class/race issues for summons on oBG2</li>
              <li>Fixed a conflict with One Pixel Productions over Cause X Wounds spells</li>
              <li>Fixed a conflict with Item Revisions over the Wand of Monster Summoning</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Thanks to TotoR, Smashing Wave and Wall of Moonlight now work on oBG2. He also provided (further) cosmetic improvements for Shout and Great Shout. </li>
          <li>Based on feedback from Galactygon, <strong>Icewind Dale Casting Graphics</strong> now looks a lot better and includes casting sounds</li>
          <li>The <strong>IWD Class Updates: Druid: Use IWD Shapeshifting and Ability Progression </strong>component was only being applied to un-kitted druids. The component will now test kits and, if they're also using the base druid abilities, make these changes as appropriate. The upshot being that Avengers now receive the new shapeshifting and abilities. </li>
          <li>The spell components would fail to install in French; unfortunately these need an updated French translation to work and will now skip </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Release Candidate 1 - July 25, 2021</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A major overhaul of the way the <strong>Arcane </strong>and<strong> Divine Spell Packs</strong> and bard songs for <strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard</strong> are handled. Specifically, these are now pulled from the newly updated IWDEE 2.6 release and worked from there. In the future, it should be easier to pull these resources from future IWDEE patches. </li>
          <li>While spells were sourced from the new 2.6 IWDEE patch, additional issues were addressed for the mod (and submitted to Beamdog and/or BG2 Fixpack, as appropriate):
            <ul>
    <li>You could indefinitely delay the fatigue effects of Blood Rage by re-casting it</li>
    <li>Cloudburst now removes Fireshield and will protect from Aura of Flaming Death for its duration</li>
    <li>Wall of Moonlight could potentially interact with spell protections, unlike other area-of-effect spells</li>
    <li>Static Charge could be dispelled, but the portrait icon would persist</li>
    <li>Animal Rage could potentially have multiple checks with spell protections, instead of just the one check when it's cast</li>
    <li>Mold Touch could potentially leave its target in state 'Diseased' permanently, instead of just during the spell's duration</li>
    <li>Mass Cause Light Wounds was available to druids (and rangers and shamans) despite none of the other Cause X Wounds spells being available</li>
    <li>Beltyn's Burning Blood was bypassing magic resistance checks in nearly all situations</li>
    <li>Emotion, Fear would always remove the effects of Emotion, Courage even when the target resisted via save or magic resistance</li>
    <li>On a failed save, targets of Great Shout would receive duplicate combat feedback and other effects</li>
    <li>Lich Touch now uses paralyze, not hold, as its on-hit effect, bringing it inline with other undead attacks</li>
    <li>Darts of all types set the user's APR to 3, however, the APR boost on Darts of Bone had a save  and could fail as a result</li>
    <li>One of the generic BG2 priest AI scripts (EE and original) could get stuck in a loop when it tried to cast Confusion</li>
    <li>Cause Disease is an abjuration, but its description still listed it as necromancy</li>
  </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Fixed many graphical issues with the spells, namely, that they were too transparent on vanilla BG2 or had black fogs around the new graphics. </li>
          <li>Renamed the <strong>Bard Song</strong> component as <strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard</strong>, as it's now part of a broader series</li>
          <li>Added new components to bring in IWD class abilities under the names <strong>IWD Class Updates: Druid</strong>, <strong>IWD Class Updates: Paladin</strong>, and <strong>IWD Class Updates: Thief.</strong> A ranger update is similarly planned, but requires a <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/32911-crowdsource-help-request-writing-snippets-for-areas/">bit of community help</a> for the tracking component. </li>
          <li>The changes made to the arcane spell Polymorph Self were broken into their own component, <strong>Expanded Polymorph Self</strong>, instead of being rolled into the <strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong></li>
          <li>Added  <strong>Additional Portrait Icons</strong>  as a separate component for vanilla BG2, since it has the potential to not play nicely with other mods</li>
          <li>Shout, Great Shout, and Mordenkainen's Force Missiles have been made available in vanilla BG2 as part of the <strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong>. IWD's version of Mordenkainern's Sword is  added as Mordenkainen's Force Blade instead of replacing the existing BG2 version. </li>
          <li>Mold Touch is now available available in vanilla BG2 as part of the <strong>Divine Spell Pack</strong></li>
          <li>Spell Revisions has a component where Spell Deflection can now protect against area-of-effect spells, and IWDification now takes this into account when installing new spells.</li>
          <li>Blood Rage was not really working on vanilla BG2; in an attempt to keep it ally-only it ended up working on pretty much no one instead.</li>
          <li>Lich Touch now has its saving throws sorted for vanilla BG2</li>
          <li>Resolved a potential conflict with SCS (and other spell mods) by correcting the internal names of Symbol, Pain and Symbol, Hopelessness</li>
          <li>Cure Moderate Wounds is now added correctly to temples which offer healing</li>
          <li>Decastave will crash oBG2 if cast when an offhand weapon or shield is equipped. As such, it's changed to be a one-handed staff weapon, like the staff-mace. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 6 - May 22, 2020</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Corrected a logic error which allocated the wrong animations, and prevented Giant Insect from installing, if you installed the Arcane and Divine spellpacks without quitting the installer between them</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 5 - January 10, 2018</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Polymorph Self always listed boring beetle as an available form, even when it wasn't</li>
          <li>Bard Songs were updated to their IWDEE counterparts, and several bugs cleaned up</li>
          <li>New arcane spell scrolls are now available in the Black Pits, Black Pits II, and Siege of Dragonspear areas, as appropriate (thanks AstroBryGuy)</li>
          <li>Cleaned up the tra files, and wrote a tool to assist translators</li>
          <li>An internal 'Testing' component was erroneously included in Beta 4 and has been removed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 4 - January 8, 2018</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Completely rebuilt the spell components upon the work of  IWDEE. As such, all spells work for the EE engine and were backported (again) to the vanilla engine, with a lot of bugfixes along the way. Several spells which were heretofore unavailable--such as Seven Eyes or Wall of Moonlight--now work for the EE engine.</li>
          <li>Two-handed axes now use halberds for their description images</li>
          <li>The icon for Battle Standard's ability is now properly transparent</li>
          <li>Updated the code for Commoners Use Drab Colors to the more robust version from Tweaks Anthology</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 3 - August 28, 2013</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cure Moderate Wounds had an incorrect icon reference, which could cause crashes when you tried to memorize the spell</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 2 - August 18, 2013</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Made a first pass at having the new spell icons blend in</li>
          <li>Added lore and prices to Two-Handed Axes</li>
          <li>Cat's Grace wasn't being added to any stores</li>
          <li>Added Cure Moderate Wounds</li>
          <li>Shambling mounds summoned by Stalker no longer drop their paws</li>
          <li>Entropy Shield wasn't blocking Icelance </li>
          <li>Emotion: Hopelessness scroll now has icon</li>
          <li>Blood Rage had an extraneous effect that would kill the target</li>
          <li>Alicorn Lance now uses a nicer glow on the target</li>
          <li>Static Charge's initial charge worked, but not its followup damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 1 - July 18, 2013</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Initial release. Let's see what breaks.</li>
