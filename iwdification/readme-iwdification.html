        <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification is a mod to   bring some of the elements of Icewind Dale into the Baldur's Gate series   of games. A lot of this project is based upon the work of the discontinued <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/155-icewind-dale-in-baldurs-gate-ii/"><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></a> conversion project, which later formed the backbone of IWDEE. </p>
        <p>Please report any bugs on the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/185-iwdification/">forums</a> so that they can be addressed. </p>

        <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification  works on all <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games that use the Baldur's Gate II engine, which includes the original   Baldur's Gate II (Shadows of Amn with or without  Throne of Bhaal), the   two major Baldur's Gate conversion mods (Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>),   and the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II. Content will be adjusted as   appropriate for the detected platform--e.g. no +5 items or ninth level   spells will be added to a Tutu or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym> game. </p>
<p><strong>For non-EE games: </strong></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> is   highly recommended for players using the spell packs on the original games. Without TobEx,   spell selection screens during character creation are limited to 24   spells, as are spellbook pages. Since there are more than 24 spells   available at some levels you will not be able to see all spells   available or be able to select them. Cat's Grace, a second-level arcane   spell, relies on functionality provided by TobEx and will be skipped if   it's not detected. </p>
        <p>The fourth-level divine spell Giant Insect relies on <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>, as the beetles summoned by the spell do not have animations in the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,   and will be skipped without the mod being installed. Polymorph Self and druidic shapeshifting will also have an additional option, Boring Beetle, if IA is installed. </p>

      <p>If you should encounter any bugs, please report them to the authors at the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/185-iwdification/">IWDification</a> forum. In addition, IWDification is <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/iwdification">available on GitHub</a>, so fixes and changes can be submitted by the community. </p>
      <h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>Two-handed axes use the same combat and paperdoll animations as halberds. </p>
      <p>Contact Other Plane has no dialogue written, and is therefore unavailable at present. </p>
      <p>Arcane spell scrolls are only available in stores, and the new arcane and divine spells are currently not utilized by enemies. </p>
      <h3>Known Issues (Non-EE Games)      </h3>
      <p>For the Arcane and Divine spell packs, not all spells could be converted to the original Baldur's Gate II engine. The Cat's Grace spell (part of the Arcane Spell Pack) requires <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> for its unique dexterity modifications. Giant Insect (part of the Divine Spell Pack) requires the beetle animation, part of <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>. A more detailed breakdown is available in the technical notes section below. </p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
      </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.      </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
      The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        IWDification for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> and the folder<strong>iwdification</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        IWDification for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdification</strong>, <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong>, and the folder<strong>iwdification</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        IWDification for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall iwdification in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-iwdification --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</p>

      <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification has several      components, which can be installed completely independently of one another. The components are broken into three broad categories. </p>

      <h3>Miscellaneous Changes </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Icewind Dale Casting Graphics (Andyr)</strong><br />
      <em>Also available in the Tweaks Anthology mod </em></p>
<p> When your character casts a spell, you get a pretty sequence of colors swirling      around their hand depending on the school the spell cast came from. A necromantic      spell, for example, looks quite different from creating an illusion. The      Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games use different sets of animations for      the schools. This component changes the spellcasting animations to those      of Icewind Dale. Note that this is purely a cosmetic change--the spells      themselves function exactly as before. Screenshots for comparison are available      in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/27-tweaks-anthology/">Tweaks      gallery</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Commoners Use Drab Colors</strong><br />
      <em>Also available in the Tweaks Anthology mod </em></p>
<p> Unlike Icewind Dale, commoners in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> wear      brightly colored clothes. This tweak changes the random selections of colors      for commoners to a drab palette. The dress of noblemen and noblewomen are      not affected. </p>
<p><strong>Two Handed Axes</strong></p>
<p>Icewind Dale also featured two-handed axes, as opposed to the   strictly one-handed variety found in the Baldur's Gate series. This   component scatters normal and magical two-handed axes throughout the   game to make them available for players. Two-handed axes use the axe   proficiency and have base stats of 9 speed and <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym> damage. Spoilers about their <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/29150-2h-axe-location-documentation-where/?tab=comments#comment-258090">precise locations</a> are available on the forums. </p>
<p><strong>Expanded Polymorph Self Options</strong></p>
<p>This component adds three new forms to the arcane Polymorph Self spell: winter wolf, polar bear, and boring beetle (the boring beetle requires <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a> on original BG2). </p>

<p><strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong></p>
      <p> This component adds more than 30 arcane spells from Icewind Dale. This component does not alter existing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> spells to match their <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> counterparts, except as noted below. <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwdification/arcane/">Complete descriptions</a> are available on the project pages as well as in-depth technical information. </p>

      <sup>2</sup> Only available for EE games OR vanilla games with TobEx installed</p>
<p><strong>Divine Spell Pack </strong></p>
      <p> This component adds more than 40 divine spells from Icewind Dale and does not alter existing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> spells to match their <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> counterparts. Divine spellcasters will receive these spells, as appropriate, in their spellbooks as they level up. Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> also receive updates to their spellbooks to account for the new spells. <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwdification/divine/">Complete descriptions</a> are available on the project pages as well as in-depth technical information. </p>
      <ul>

      <p><sup>1</sup> Only available for EE games<br />
      <sup>2</sup> Only available for EE games OR vanilla games with Infinity Animations installed</p>
      <p><strong>Expanded Portrait Icons</strong><br />
      <em>Non-EE Games Only</em></p>
      <p>On the Enhanced Editions, all of the Icewind Dale portrait icons for the spells int he <strong>Arcane </strong>and<strong> Divine Spell Packs</strong> and the songs from <strong>IWD CLass Updates: Bard</strong>. Unlike the Enhanced Editions, portrait icons are limited to a fixed number of slots and, as such, many of the imported spells and bard songs do not get their unique portrait icons. These are made available as a separate component because there's no easy way to patch these into the game and this component will destructively overwrite changes made by other mods to expand the portrait icon system.</p>
    </div>  
    <div class="ribbon_rectangle_h3">
      <h3>IWD Class Updates</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
<p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard (formerly known as Bard Song</strong>)</p>
      <p>Bards in Icewind Dale gained different bard songs as they leveled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Ballad of Three Heroes - Available at level one, this   provides all allies with +1 to hit, +1 damage, and +1 to saving throws.</li>
        <li>The Tale of Curran Strongheart - Available at level three, this   song protects the party from fear and removes any current fear effects.</li>
        <li>Tymora's Melody - Available at level five, the party gains +1 luck, +3 to all saves, and +10 to lore and thieving skills.</li>
        <li>The Song of Kaudies - Available at level seven, this provides a   50% resistance to sound-based attacks and spells such as power words,   sirine charm, silence, and others.</li>
        <li>The Siren's Yearning - Available at level nine, this song   enthralls your foes, preventing action for five rounds on a failed save   vs. spell.</li>
        <li>War Chant of the Sith - Available at level 11, this provides +2 <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>, regeneration of two <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym>/round, and 10% resistance to all crushing, missile, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As the songs become available to the bard, the ability to freely   switch between them is available. This component only affects trueclass   bards, as the available kits use variants of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> bard song for kit advantages and/or disadvantages. Bards with these new songs will not be able to pick Enhanced Bard Song as a high-level ability. </p>
      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Druid</strong></p>
      <p> There are two options which can be installed separately or together. The first, <strong>Allow Elves to be Druids</strong>, does exactly that: it opens the druid class and fighter-druid multi-class to elves, but is only available on EE games.. </p>
      <p>The second, <strong>Use IWD Shapeshifting and Ability Progression</strong>, makes several changes to the druid class. Druids swap their BG2 shapeshifting (wolf, black bear, bown bear) for the IWD progression: winter wolf (level 5), boring beetle (level 7, but kept as black bear for vanilla games without <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>), polar bear (level 9), fire elemental (level 11), earth elemental (level 13), and water elemental (level 15). Immunity from poison is moved from level 15 to level 9, and instead of the BG2 elemental resists at levels 18/21/24, the druid becomes immune to fatigue at level 15. </p>
      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Paladin</strong></p>
      <p>The paladin's Detect Evil ability becomes an at-will ability, and Protection From Evil only protects the paladin but lasts 24 hours. Paladins can cast Cure Disease (per the cleric spell) once per day and Smite Evil once per day (does 1d6 plus 1d6 per thee levels of magic damage to an evil opponent). Paladins are now immune to disease and become immune to fear at level three. They also receive an expanded spellcasting table, being able to start casting spells at level 6 instead of 9. </p>
      <p><strong>IWD Class Updates: Thief</strong><br />
      <em>Enhanced Edition Only</em></p>
      <p>At level seven, thieves earn the Evasion perk. When a thief is hit by a spell that can be evaded (Fireball, Lightning Bolt, etc.), the thief is allowed a Save vs. Breath to completely avoid the effects. If the Saving Throw is failed, the spell works normally, including a save for half damage if the spell allows for it. A helpless thief (e.g. held, stunned, or asleep) cannot use Evasion.</p>

      <p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
        more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
        hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
        get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
        work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
        from the author(s). </p>
      <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>

        <p><strong>Version Release Candidate 1 - July 8, 2021</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A major overhaul of the way the Arcane and Dvine Spell packs and bard songs for <strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard</strong> are handled. Specifically, these are now pulled from the newly updated IWDEE 2.6 release and worked from there. </li>
          <li>Fixed many graphical issues with the spells, namely, that they were too transparent on vanilla BG2 or had black fogs around the new graphics. </li>
          <li>Renamed the <strong>Bard Song</strong> component as <strong>IWD Class Updates: Bard</strong>, as its now part of a broader series</li>
          <li>Add components to bring in IWD class abilities under the names <strong>IWD Class Updates: Druid</strong>, <strong>IWD Class Updates: Paladin</strong>, and <strong>IWD Class Updates: Thief.</strong></li>
          <li>The changes made to the arcane spell Polymorph Self were broken into their own component, <strong>Expanded Polymorph Self</strong>, instead of being rolled into the <strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong></li>
          <li>Added  <strong>Additional Portrait Icons</strong>  as a separate component for vanilla BG2, since it has the potential to not play nicely with other mods</li>
          <li>Shout, Great Shout, and Mordenkainen's Force Missiles have been made available in vanilla BG2 as part of the <strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong>. IWD's version of Mordenkainern's Sword is now added as Mordenkainen's Force Blade instead of replacing the existing BG2 version. </li>
          <li>Spell Revisions has a component where Spell Deflection can now protect against area-of-effect spells, and IWDification now takes this into account when installing new spells.</li>
          <li>Blood Rage was not really working on vanilla BG2; in an attempt to keep it ally-only it ended up working on pretty much no one instead.</li>
          <li>Lich Touch now has its saving throws sorted for vanilla BG2</li>
          <li>Resolved a potential conflict with SCS (and other spell mods) by correcting the internal names of Symbol, Pain and Symbol, Hopelessness</li>
          <li>Cure Moderate Wounds is now added correctly to temples which offer healing</li>
          <li>Decastave will crash oBG2 if cast when an offhand weapon or shield is equipped. As such, it's changed to be a one-handed staff weapon, like the staff-mace. </li>
          <li>Cause Disease was classed as an abjuration spell instead of its correct school of necromancy</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 6 - May 22, 2020</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Corrected a logic error which allocated the wrong animations, and prevented Giant Insect from installing, if you installed the Arcane and Divine spellpacks without quitting the installer between them</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 5 - January 10, 2018</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Polymorph Self always listed boring beetle as an available form, even when it wasn't</li>
          <li>Bard Songs were updated to their IWDEE counterparts, and several bugs cleaned up</li>
          <li>New arcane spell scrolls are now available in the Black Pits, Black Pits II, and Siege of Dragonspear areas, as appropriate (thanks AstroBryGuy)</li>
          <li>Cleaned up the tra files, and wrote a tool to assist translators</li>
          <li>An internal 'Testing' component was erroneously included in Beta 4 and has been removed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 4 - January 8, 2018</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Completely rebuilt the spell components upon the work of  IWDEE. As such, all spells work for the EE engine and were backported (again) to the vanilla engine, with a lot of bugfixes along the way. Several spells which were heretofore unavailable--such as Seven Eyes or Wall of Moonlight--now work for the EE engine.</li>
          <li>Two-handed axes now use halberds for their description images</li>
          <li>The icon for Battle Standard's ability is now properly transparent</li>
          <li>Updated the code for Commoners Use Drab Colors to the more robust version from Tweaks Anthology</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 3 - August 28, 2013</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cure Moderate Wounds had an incorrect icon reference, which could cause crashes when you tried to memorize the spell</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 2 - August 18, 2013</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Made a first pass at having the new spell icons blend in</li>
          <li>Added lore and prices to Two-Handed Axes</li>
          <li>Cat's Grace wasn't being added to any stores</li>
          <li>Added Cure Moderate Wounds</li>
          <li>Shambling mounds summoned by Stalker no longer drop their paws</li>
          <li>Entropy Shield wasn't blocking Icelance </li>
          <li>Emotion: Hopelessness scroll now has icon</li>
          <li>Blood Rage had an extraneous effect that would kill the target</li>
          <li>Alicorn Lance now uses a nicer glow on the target</li>
          <li>Static Charge's initial charge worked, but not its followup damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Version Beta 1 - July 18, 2013</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Initial release. Let's see what breaks.</li>
